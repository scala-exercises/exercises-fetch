 * Fetch is built using Cats' Free monad construction and thus works out of the box with
 * cats syntax. Using Cats' syntax, we can make fetch declarations more concise, without
 * the need to use the combinators in the `Fetch` companion object.
 *
 * Fetch provides its own instance of `Applicative[Fetch]`. Whenever we use applicative
 * operations on more than one `Fetch`, we know that the fetches are independent meaning
 * we can perform optimizations such as batching and concurrent requests.
 *
 * If we were to use the default `Applicative[Fetch]` operations, which are implemented in terms of `flatMap`,
 * we wouldn't have information about the independency of multiple fetches.
