 * =Error handling=
 *
 * Fetch is used for reading data from remote sources and the queries we perform can and will fail
 * at some point. There are many things that can go wrong:
 *
 *   - an exception can be thrown by client code of certain data sources
 *   - an identity may be missing
 *   - the data source may be temporarily available
 *
 * Since the error cases are plenty and canâ€™t be anticipated Fetch errors are represented by the
 * 'FetchException' trait, which extends `Throwable`. Currently fetch defines `FetchException` cases
 * for missing identities and arbitrary exceptions but you can extend `FetchException` with any
 * error you want.
