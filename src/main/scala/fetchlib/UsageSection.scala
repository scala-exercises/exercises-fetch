/**
 * = Introduction =
 *
 * Fetch is a library that allows your data fetches to be written in a concise,
 * composable way while executing efficiently. You don't need to use any explicit
 * concurrency construct but existing idioms: applicative for concurrency and
 * monad for sequencing.
 *
 * Oftentimes, our applications read and manipulate data from a variety of
 * different sources such as databases, web services or file systems. These data
 * sources are subject to latency, and we'd prefer to query them efficiently.
 *
 * If we are just reading data, we can make a series of optimizations such as:
 *
 *  - batching requests to the same data source
 *  - requesting independent data from different sources in parallel
 *  - caching previously seen results
 *
 * However, if we mix these optimizations with the code that fetches the data
 * we may end up trading clarity for performance. Furthermore, we are
 * mixing low-level (optimization) and high-level (business logic with the data
 * we read) concerns.
 *
 * = Installation =
 *
 * To begin, add the following dependency to your SBT build file:
 *
 * {{{
 * "com.47deg" %% "fetch" % "1.2.2"
 * }}}
 *
 * Or, if using Scala.js:
 *
 * {{{
 * "com.47deg" %%% "fetch" % "1.2.2"
 * }}}
 *
 * Now you’ll have Fetch available in both Scala and Scala.js.
 *
 * = Usage =
 *
 * In order to tell Fetch how to retrieve data, we must implement the `DataSource` typeclass.
 *
 * {{{
 * import cats.effect.Concurrent
 * import cats.data.NonEmptyList
 *
 * trait DataSource[F[_], Identity, Result]{
 *   def data: Data[Identity, Result]
 *
 *   def CF: Concurrent[F]
 *
 *   def fetch(id: Identity): F[Option[Result]]
 *
 *   /* `batch` is implemented in terms of `fetch` by default */
 *   def batch(ids: NonEmptyList[Identity]): F[Map[Identity, Result]]
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * It takes two type parameters:
 *
 *  - `Identity`: the identity we want to fetch (a `UserId` if we were fetching users)
 *  - `Result`: the type of the data we retrieve (a `User` if we were fetching users)
 *
 * There are two methods: `fetch` and `batch`. `fetch` receives one identity and must return
 * a `Concurrent` containing
 * an optional result. Returning an `Option` Fetch can detect whether an identity couldn't be
 * fetched or no longer exists.
 *
 * `batch` method takes a non-empty list of identities and must return a `Concurrent` containing
 * a map from identities to results. Accepting a list of identities gives Fetch the ability to batch
 * requests to the same data source, and returning a mapping from identities to results, Fetch can
 * detect whenever an identity couldn’t be fetched or no longer exists.
 *
 * The `data` method returns a `Data[Identity, Result]` instance that Fetch uses to optimize requests to the
 * same data source, and is expected to return a singleton `object` that extends `Data[Identity, Result]`.
 *
 * = Writing your first data source =
 *
 * Now that we know about the `DataSource` typeclass, let's write our first data source! We'll start by
 * implementing a data source for fetching users given their id.
 * The first thing we'll do is define the types for user ids and users.
 *
 * {{{
 * type UserId = Int
 * case class User(id: UserId, username: String)
 * }}}
 *
 * We’ll simulate unpredictable latency with this function.
 * {{{
 * import cats.effect._
 * import cats.syntax.all._
 *
 * def latency[F[_] : Concurrent](msg: String): F[Unit] = for {
 *   _ <- Sync[F].delay(println(s"--> [${Thread.currentThread.getId}] $msg"))
 *   _ <- Sync[F].delay(Thread.sleep(100))
 *   _ <- Sync[F].delay(println(s"<-- [${Thread.currentThread.getId}] $msg"))
 * } yield ()
 * }}}
 * And now we're ready to write our user data source;
 * we'll emulate a database with an in-memory map.
 *
 * {{{
 * import cats.data.NonEmptyList
 * import cats.instances.list._
 * import fetch._
 *
 * val userDatabase: Map[UserId, User] = Map(
 *   1 -> User(1, "@one"),
 *   2 -> User(2, "@two"),
 *   3 -> User(3, "@three"),
 *   4 -> User(4, "@four")
 * )
 *
 * object Users extends Data[UserId, User] {
 *   def name = "Users"
 *
 *   def source[F[_] : Concurrent]: DataSource[F, UserId, User] = new DataSource[F, UserId, User] {
 *     override def data = Users
 *
 *     override def CF = Concurrent[F]
 *
 *     override def fetch(id: UserId): F[Option[User]] =
 *       latency[F](s"One User $id") >> CF.pure(userDatabase.get(id))
 *
 *     override def batch(ids: NonEmptyList[UserId]): F[Map[UserId, User]] =
 *       latency[F](s"Batch Users $ids") >> CF.pure(userDatabase.filterKeys(ids.toList.toSet).toMap)
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * Now that we have a data source we can write a function for fetching users
 * given an id, we just have to pass a `UserId` as an argument to `Fetch`.
 *
 * {{{
 * def getUser[F[_] : Concurrent](id: UserId): Fetch[F, User] =
 *   Fetch(id, Users.source)
 * }}}
 *
 * = Optional identities =
 *
 * If you want to create a Fetch that doesn’t fail if the identity is not found, you can use
 * `Fetch#optional` instead of `Fetch#apply`. Note that instead of a `Fetch[F, A]` you will get a
 * `Fetch[F, Option[A]]`.
 *
 * {{{
 * def maybeGetUser[F[_] : Concurrent](id: UserId): Fetch[F, Option[User]] =
 *   Fetch.optional(id, Users.source)
 * }}}
 *
 * = Data sources that don’t support batching =
 *
 * If your data source doesn’t support batching, you can simply leave the `batch` method unimplemented.
 * Note that it will use the `fetch` implementation for requesting identities in parallel.
 * {{{
 * object Unbatched extends Data[Int, Int]{
 *   def name = "Unbatched"
 *
 *   def source[F[_] : Concurrent]: DataSource[F, Int, Int] = new DataSource[F, Int, Int]{
 *     override def data = Unbatched
 *
 *     override def CF = Concurrent[F]
 *
 *     override def fetch(id: Int): F[Option[Int]] =
 *       CF.pure(Option(id))
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * = Batching individuals requests sequentially =
 *
 * The default `batch` implementation run requests to the data source in parallel, but you can easily
 * override it. We can make `batch` sequential using `NonEmptyList.traverse` for fetching individual
 * identities.
 *
 * {{{
 * object UnbatchedSeq extends Data[Int, Int]{
 *   def name = "UnbatchedSeq"
 *
 *   def source[F[_] : Concurrent]: DataSource[F, Int, Int] = new DataSource[F, Int, Int]{
 *     override def data = UnbatchedSeq
 *
 *     override def CF = Concurrent[F]
 *
 *     override def fetch(id: Int): F[Option[Int]] =
 *       CF.pure(Option(id))
 *
 *     override def batch(ids: NonEmptyList[Int]): F[Map[Int, Int]] =
 *       ids.traverse(
 *         (id) => fetch(id).map(v => (id, v))
 *       ).map(_.collect { case (i, Some(x)) => (i, x) }.toMap)
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * = Data sources that only support batching =
 *
 * If your data source only supports querying it in batches, you can implement `fetch` in terms of `batch`.
 * {{{
 * object OnlyBatched extends Data[Int, Int]{
 *   def name = "OnlyBatched"
 *
 *   def source[F[_] : Concurrent]: DataSource[F, Int, Int] = new DataSource[F, Int, Int]{
 *     override def data = OnlyBatched
 *
 *     override def CF = Concurrent[F]
 *
 *     override def fetch(id: Int): F[Option[Int]] =
 *       batch(NonEmptyList(id, List())).map(_.get(id))
 *
 *     override def batch(ids: NonEmptyList[Int]): F[Map[Int, Int]] =
 *       CF.pure(ids.map(x => (x, x)).toList.toMap)
